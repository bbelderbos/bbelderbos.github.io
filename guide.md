### Where to start?

I have been writing here about software, web development, technology and my learning for the last {{ site.time | date: '%Y' |Â minus:2009 }} years. On this page I have grouped some of my posts and creations. If you like what you see, consider joining my private mailing list at the bottom of the page. Thanks for reading!

### Becoming a (better) programmer

Programming is my main occupation. Where did I start, how to get better?

* [How I got fired up about programming](2016/02/fired-up-about-programming/) goes back to the origin of my journey as a programmer.
* Over the last few years [I earned certifications](2016/02/certified-advanced-java/) in Python and Java at the O'Reilly School of Technology.
* [How to grow in the craft of programming](2012/08/how-to-grow-craft-programming/)?
* I keep rereading Chad Fowler's [The passionate programmer](2011/04/advance-career-read-passionate-programmer/), inspiring!

### Software Best Practices

Just a few resources from the blog. I frequently update [my reading page](books) where I have a section about software development books.

* Required reading: [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.](2011/02/great-book-about-software-engineering/).
* 10 guidelines that will make you write more maintainable software, review/learning of the book [Building maintainable software](2016/03/building-maintainable-software/).
* Some posts on software development best practices: [I) Programming Techniques](2012/06/best-practices-software-development-programming-techniques/), [II) Good Coding Methodologies](2012/07/best-practices-software-development-good-coding-methodologies/), and [becoming a good debugger](2011/07/becoming-good-debugger/).

### Tools / utilities I created

Most of my blog content is around building useful things to cover practical needs. Here is a selection, see the [archive](archive) for all posts.

* [Tweet digest](2012/03/easy-way-compile-tweet-digest/): a tool to easily get a selection of your tweets for your blog or site.
* My first [Android game](2015/04/my-first-android-game-free-monkey/), built as the final project of [Android 1](http://archive.oreilly.com/oreillyschool/courses/courses.html#course_id_157) (O'Reilly).
* A [script](2015/11/new-safari-books-notification-email/) to monitor what gets added to [safaribooksonline](http://safaribooksonline.com/). I turned it into a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/newsafaribooks) even.
* Other scraping scripts: [daily mail of all movies aired on Spanish TV](2012/09/perl-practice-daily-mail-of-movies-spanish-tv/) ([Python version](2013/01/movies-aired-on-spanish-tv-part2-python/)). I also created a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cine_tv_es) for this one (I will soon write a post on automating data flow with Twitter bots).
* Terminal fun: [How to search and copy Stack Overflow data without leaving Vim!](2013/01/search-copy-stackoverflow-data-in-vim-with-conque/)

### Web design

No good program without appropriate design, I love building functional sites that look nice!

* Some iterations of my site: [2009 - first design](http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/bb_website_2009.jpg) (still proud of this one). Revamps: [2010](2010/09/new-website-design/), [2013](2013/02/responsive-website-redesign/), and recently [I migrated to the ultra fast Jekyll](2016/01/migrating-to-jekyll/).
* You can see some of my webdesigns at my [Portfolio site](http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/portfolio/).
* My movie site and first Facebook API project: [Sharemovi.es](http://sharemovi.es/) (uses themoviedb API, [launch post](2010/11/sneak-preview-sharemovies/)).
* Weekend project in 2011 (Facebook API): [My Reading List](http://fbreadinglist.com/) (uses Google Books API, [launch post](2011/03/new-facebook-app-my-reading-list/)).
* More FB apps (not all online or working now): [globe explorer](http://bobbelderbos.com/globe/), [friends jukebox](2011/06/new-facebook-app-friends-jukebox/), [never forget a birthday](2011/07/example-simple-facebook-canvasapp-never-forget-a-birthday/). Latter I really want to redo as a mobile app!

### Time saving tools (Git, Vim, Shell)

We are all busy, but some repetitions are just boring/ annoying. Enter power tools that make our developer lives easier and that make me smile, every day :)

* Vi(m) saves me tons of hours and editing at the speed of light has its natural high. Read my [5 tips that helped me becoming faster in Vim](2012/09/5-tips-for-becoming-faster-in-vim/), then check out what probably (still) is [the best book on vim](2012/10/book-review-practical-vim-edit-text-at-the-speed-of-thought/).
* I cannot live without Git anymore, here is a post to [get started](2012/02/git-in-a-nutshell/) and another post to [get better](2013/03/master-intermediate-git-operations/). Learn how to [push your code to a remote web server](2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/) and here is a [simple bash script to clone remote git repositories](2012/07/simple-bash-script-to-clone-remote-git-repositories/).
* Daily need: [how to push your code to your remote web server with Git](2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/).
* Speed up time with these [command line tricks](2013/05/be-more-productive-with-unix-shell/), [ssh tricks](2013/05/ssh-tricks-remote-servers/) and learn some shell scripting golf, e.g. use this [one-liner to download a podcast feed](2013/12/podcast-scripting-golf/).

### Popular by traffic (likes)

Although I don't guide my writing by stats, it is interesting to see what gets most traction. These articles were hot:

* One of my tophitter articles is about creating your own movie database. Why? People want to work with movie data, but often don't know where to start. Here is your jumpstart: [Your own movie database in 5 minutes with IMDb API and Perl](2011/11/movie-database-imdb-api-perl/). Disclaimer: not the best Perl code I've written, so I owed you a [better version in Python](2016/02/movie-site-in-minute-omdb-api-python/).
* Another popular article (need) at the time was [Let Facebook "Like" button pick the right image](2011/03/facebook-like-button-right-image/). Hundreds of FB likes, at the top of google search. Lesson learned: fulfill a specific need!
* To a lesser extent but still visited a lot on a daily basis is this practical CSS post: [how to make a fixed sidebar or header with CSS](2012/03/how-to-make-a-fixed-sidebar-or-header-with-css/)

---

### Last but not least: writing and productivity

Writing is one of the most important skills to develop, and being conscience about productivity gets you on the fast track: 

* Check out my article on the [10 steps of becoming proficient at blogging](2011/07/10-steps-proficient-blogger/).
* And to remind myself to stay productive I created some notes: [Increase productivity by 3+ times](2010/09/increase-productivity-by-3-times/) and the [5 power habits that will make you instantly more successful](2016/02/power-habits/).

---

And where are the books? I shelve those on my [books](books) page. For the new reads I am adding book pages with notes, see for example [The power of habit](books/PowerHabit.html).

Thanks again for stopping by. I hope you enjoy this blog. If there was one thing I could write about that'd make your day better, <a href="mailto:info@bobbelderbos.com?Subject=Please%20write%20about%20..." target="_top">what would it be?</a>
