I have been writing here about software and web development for the last {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2009 }} years. 

On this page some of my articles and projects, and a couple of books I found really useful. 

See the [archive](archive) for all my posts. I keep track of my reading [here](http://bobbelderbos.com/books/).
