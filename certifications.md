- Develop effective JUnit test cases to validate the execution of these controllers.
- Develop a testing framework that maximizes code coverage of JUnit test cases.
- From the very first lab, you will be developing a client/server application, adding new features and functionality with each successive lab. You will learn by following the design and implementation of the application in the lab. Each quiz will validate that you learned the key information and the projects, performed at your pace, will describe useful extensions to the main development of the overall project.
- From beginning to end, you will learn by doing your own Java projects within our Eclipse Learning Sandbox, which we affectionately call “Ellipse.” These projects will add to your portfolio and provide needed experience.
