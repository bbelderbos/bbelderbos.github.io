## SIG / PEOPLECERT

### Quality Software Development: Maintainability Foundation

I certified in Quality Software Developer (#QSDcert) via SIG / PEOPLECERT. [In this post](http://bobbelderbos.com/2016/07/certified-software-quality/) I share what the exam is about, why I think it is a must have for a software developer, and how you can prepare for it.

### Quality Software Development Advanced Certificate

I also obtained SIG's advanced certificate in Oct 2017. It covered building software teams following the goal, question, metric or GQM approach. The material included topics like version control, automated tests/deployment (CI), environments and working with third-party code. You can read more about it [here](https://bobbelderbos.com/2017/02/building-software-teams/).

## OReilly School of Technology (OST)

I obtained various programming certificates at the O'Reilly School of Technology (OST). As OST is unfortunately closing end of this month (Jan 2016) I pasted the course info below as a reference what I learned. The nice thing about these courses was that they were very practical, you learned by doing, building projects, submitting them for instructor feedback. These projects have contributed greatly to my coding skills and building up a library of useful code.

### Java Programming 5: Distributed Java Applications

> Learn to develop a client/server distributed Java application from the ground up. Here you will exercise all of your Java skills to implement a graphical client that communicates with a remote back-end server using XML messages. You will learn the tradeoffs that are common in client/server systems and gain valuable insights into how to design your own distributed, multi-threaded applications. Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Extend your stand-alone Graphical User Interfaces to communicate with a remote server.
- Develop a multi-threaded server that simultaneously supports a number of connected clients.
- Design a protocol using an XML XSD specification.
- Develop client- and server-side controllers that follow the protocol.
- Develop effective JUnit test cases to validate the execution of these controllers.
- Develop a testing framework that maximizes code coverage of JUnit test cases.
- From the very first lab, you will be developing a client/server application, adding new features and functionality with each successive lab. You will learn by following the design and implementation of the application in the lab. Each quiz will validate that you learned the key information and the projects, performed at your pace, will describe useful extensions to the main development of the overall project.
