### Quality Software Development: Maintainability Foundation

![Quality software certificate]({{ site.url }}/assets/sig_quality_software_cert.jpeg)

From [SIG's site](https://www.sig.eu/en/bettercode/):

> Demand for good software is growing very fast, however building quality software remains a major challenge. To tackle this, SIG in collaboration with PEOPLECERT, has developed a qualification in Quality Software Development to certify programmers who have the necessary skillset to produce high quality code. The program covers the fundamental knowledge required for a candidate to individually build software in either Java or C# that is sufficiently maintainable.

## OReilly School of Technology (OST)

I obtained various programming certificates at the O'Reilly School of Technology (OST). As OST is unfortunately closing end of this month (Jan 2016) I pasted the course info below as a reference what I learned. The nice thing about these courses was that they were very practical, you learned by doing, building projects, submitting them for instructor feedback. These projects have contributed greatly to my coding skills and building up a library of useful code.

### Java Programming 5: Distributed Java Applications

> Learn to develop a client/server distributed Java application from the ground up. Here you will exercise all of your Java skills to implement a graphical client that communicates with a remote back-end server using XML messages. You will learn the tradeoffs that are common in client/server systems and gain valuable insights into how to design your own distributed, multi-threaded applications. Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Extend your stand-alone Graphical User Interfaces to communicate with a remote server.
- Develop a multi-threaded server that simultaneously supports a number of connected clients.
- Design a protocol using an XML XSD specification.
- Develop client- and server-side controllers that follow the protocol.
- Develop effective JUnit test cases to validate the execution of these controllers.
- Develop a testing framework that maximizes code coverage of JUnit test cases.
