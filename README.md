### Where to start?

I have been writing here about software, web development, technology and learning for {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2009 }} years. On this page I have grouped some of my posts and creations. If you like what you see here consider joining my private mailing list at the bottom of the page. Thanks for reading!

### Becoming a (better) programmer

Programming is my main occupation. Where did I start, how to get better?

* [How I got fired up about programming](2016/02/fired-up-about-programming/) goes back to the origin of my journey as a programmer.
* Over the last few years [I earned certifications](2016/02/certified-advanced-java/) in Python and Java at the O'Reilly School of Technology.
* An attempt to answer: [how to grow in the craft of programming](2012/09/how-to-grow-craft-programming/)?
* For inspiration: I keep rereading Chad Fowler's [The passionate programmer](2011/04/advance-career-read-passionate-programmer/).

### Software Best Practices

Just a few resources from the blog. I frequently update [my reading page](books) where I have a section about software development books.

* Required reading: [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.](2011/02/great-book-about-software-engineering/).
* 10 guidelines that will make you write more maintainable software, review/learning of the book [Building maintainable software](2016/03/building-maintainable-software/).
* Best practices of software development: [I) Programming Techniques](2012/06/best-practices-software-development-programming-techniques/), [II) Good Coding Methodologies](2012/07/best-practices-software-development-good-coding-methodologies/), and [becoming a good debugger](2011/07/becoming-good-debugger/).

### Tools / utilities I created

Most of my blog content is around building useful things to cover practical needs. Here is a selection, see the [archive](archive) for all posts.

* I created [Tweet digest](2012/03/easy-way-compile-tweet-digest/), a tool to easily get a selection of your tweets for your blog or site.
* I built my first [Android game](2015/04/my-first-android-game-free-monkey/) as final project of part of [Android 1](http://archive.oreilly.com/oreillyschool/courses/courses.html#course_id_157) (O'Reilly School of Technology).
* I monitor what gets added to Safaribooksonline with [this tools](2015/11/new-safari-books-notification-email/), which turned into a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/newsafaribooks).
* Other scraping scripts: [daily mail of all movies aired on Spanish TV](2012/09/perl-practice-daily-mail-of-movies-spanish-tv/) | [Python version](2013/01/movies-aired-on-spanish-tv-part2-python/) | turned into [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cine_tv_es) as well. (#TODO: write a blog post on how to create a Twitter bot).
* Terminal fun: [How to search and copy Stack Overflow data without leaving Vim!](2013/01/search-copy-stackoverflow-data-in-vim-with-conque/).

### Web design

Apart from coding I am passionate about making nice designs:

* For fun: some iterations of my site: [2009](http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/bb_website_2009.jpg) - this was my first design and I actually still love it. Revamps: [2010](2010/09/new-website-design/), [2013](2013/02/responsive-website-redesign/), and currently [I am using Jekyll](2016/01/migrating-to-jekyll/) with a nice responsive theme.
* You can see some earlier designs at my [Portfolio site](http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/portfolio/).
* My movie site and first Facebook API project: [sharemovi.es](http://sharemovi.es/) (uses themoviedb API, [initial version](2010/11/sneak-preview-sharemovies/)).
* Weekend project in 2011 (Facebook API): [My Reading List](http://fbreadinglist.com/) (uses Google Books API, [initial version](2011/03/new-facebook-app-my-reading-list/)).
* More FB apps (not all online or working now): [globe explorer](http://bobbelderbos.com/globe/), [friends jukebox](2011/06/new-facebook-app-friends-jukebox/), [never forget a birthday](2011/07/example-simple-facebook-canvasapp-never-forget-a-birthday/). Latter I really want to redo as a mobile app!

### Time saving tools (Git, Vim, Shell)

We are all busy, there are tools though that are huge time savers and make you smile every day :)

* Vi(m) saves me tons of hours and editing at the speed of light has its daily satisfaction: read my [5 tips that helped me becoming faster in Vim](2012/09/5-tips-for-becoming-faster-in-vim/), then check out what probably is still is for me [the best book on vim](2012/10/book-review-practical-vim-edit-text-at-the-speed-of-thought/).
* I cannot live without Git anymore, here is a post to [get started](2012/02/git-in-a-nutshell/) and another post to [get better](2013/03/master-intermediate-git-operations/). Learn how to [push your code to a remote web server](2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/). And finally a [simple bash script to clone remote git repositories](2012/07/simple-bash-script-to-clone-remote-git-repositories/).
* [How to push your code to your remote web server with Git](2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/).
* Speed up time with these [command line tricks](2013/05/be-more-productive-with-unix-shell/), [ssh tricks](2013/05/ssh-tricks-remote-servers/) and learn some shell scripting golf, for example a [one-liner to download a podcast feed](2013/12/podcast-scripting-golf/).

### Popular by traffic (likes)

I don't write for stats, I write to share my learning and get better. It is interesting though to look at which articles get more hits, a couple of examples:

* One of my tophitter articles is about creating your own movie database. Why? People want to work with movie data, but often don't know where to start. Here is a jumpstart: [Your own movie database in 5 minutes with IMDb API and Perl](2011/11/movie-database-imdb-api-perl/). Disclaimer: not the best Perl code I've ever written, recently wrote a [better version](2016/02/movie-site-in-minute-omdb-api-python/) in Python.
* Another popular article (need) at the time was [Let Facebook "Like" button pick the right image!](2011/03/facebook-like-button-right-image/) Search "facebook like button right image" and it pops up at the top.
* And some CSS goes a long way, [this article](How to make a fixed sidebar or header with CSS) is also frequently visited.

### Last but not least: writing and productivity

Writing is one of the most important skills to develop, and being conscience about productivity gets you on the fast track: 

* As sharing content has been hard work but rewarding I did [a post on blogging](2011/07/10-steps-proficient-blogger/).
* And to remind myself to stay productive I created some notes: [Increase productivity by 3+ times](2010/09/increase-productivity-by-3-times/) and the [5 power habits that will make you instantly more successful](2016/02/power-habits/).
