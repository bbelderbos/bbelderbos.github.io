    Great read to work on one of the most important success factors: form productive habits. 
    I read it takes 60-90 days to instill a new habit, it takes discipline and practice. 
    But it is hackable because every habit is made up of a cue, a routine, and a reward!
    This book is filled with interesting case studies, I need to recover some more notes though ...

## Notes

> "Understanding habits is the most important thing I've learned in the army," the major told me. "It's changed everything about how I see the world. You want to fall asleep fast and wake up feeling good? Pay attention to your nighttime patterns and what you automatically do when you get up. You want to make running easy? Create triggers to make it a routine. I drill my kids on this stuff. (loc. 177-180)

> He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what makes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop.  (loc. 638-639)

> This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we're not really aware they exist, so we're often blind to their influence. (loc. 853-855)

> That craving is an essential part of the formula for creating new habits that Claude Hopkins, the Pepsodent ad man, never recognized. (loc. 963-964)

> "That's why signing kids up for piano lessons or sports is so important. It has nothing to do with creating a good musician or a five-year-old soccer star," said Heatherton. "When you learn to force yourself to practice for an hour or run fifteen laps, you start building self-regulatory strength. A five-year-old who can follow the ball for ten minutes becomes a sixth grader who can start his homework on time." - (loc. 2198-2201)

> The patients who had written plans in their booklets had started walking almost twice as fast as the ones who had not. (loc. 2241-2242)

> Yet despite this capacity for internecine warfare, most companies roll along relatively peacefully, year after year, because they have routines—habits—that create truces that allow everyone to set aside their rivalries long enough to get a day's work done. (loc. 2548-2551)

> ... Whether selling a new song, a new food, or a new crib, the lesson is the same: If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it. (loc. 3273-3275)
