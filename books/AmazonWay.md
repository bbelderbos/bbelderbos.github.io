<h3 class="myNotes">Some highlights</h3>

> More than a few ex-Amazon.com employees have described the organization as a large company that functions like a start-up—meaning, I believe, that they feel as if they were required to do excellent work at a frenetic, breakneck pace while still adhering to time-consuming processes like the long-form written narrative and other elaborate communication processes.

> Jeff expects all of his people to function as both owners and leaders. He wants you to drive the business as if it were your own car, not some weekend rental.

> One of the original names for Amazon.com was Relentless.com.3 Eventually this name was jettisoned because it had too many negative connotations, but that word lives on in Jeff’s insistence on the highest standards. It takes a certain kind of personality to succeed in an organization like Amazon.com. As an employee, you really do have to adopt a long view, just like Jeff’s, and truly believe you are part of something very big—something that is changing the world.

> What’s probably most impressive is that everything at Amazon.com has an SLA—everything. For instance, the time between an image’s upload and the moment it appears on the website has an SLA.

> When you settle for the median, mediocrity sets in. That’s where many companies get SLAs wrong. Jeff relentlessly conveys to his team that even small service failures are far from trivial. For example, one of Amazon.com’s metrics shows that even a minuscule 0.1-second delay in a webpage loading can translate into a 1 percent drop in customer activity.

> Here’s the most important thing about the principles: most of them refer to the expectations that Amazon has for leaders. (You’ve probably noticed that I’ve echoed that language in this book.) It sends a subtle but powerful message that empowers every Amazon.com employee to act and think like a leader. When everyone behaves like a leader, it acts as a forcing function for the relentlessly high standards that Jeff insists upon.

> Jeff famously put the philosophy this way: Five years after an employee was hired, he said, that employee should think, “I’m glad I got hired when I did, because I wouldn’t get hired now.”

> Jeff Bezos and Amazon have a deep belief that small teams of world-class engineers can out-innovate massive bureaucracies. Why? It has a lot to do with the instinctive preference for clarity that engineers develop through a lifetime of working with numbers and system requirements. Whereas bureaucrats automatically obfuscate, engineers automatically clarify.

> To be blunt, as an Amazon.com leader, you don’t get the chance to make a lot of mistakes. Screw up for long enough, or for the wrong reasons, and the island will simply vote you off. It is the strongest culture of performance I have ever experienced, and it is directly tied to metrics and results.

> If you want to increase your chances of achieving your goals when launching any important initiative, make sure you define and explain those goals with utter clarity from the very beginning. The future press release is a useful tool for making that happen.

> So useful is this technique that an Amazon product launch almost always begins with what we used to call a future press release—an announcement of the product written before its development even began, used for internal purposes only. Crafting the future press release forced us to articulate for ourselves what would be newsworthy about the product at the very end of the development process.

> As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything”. Jeff believes that reliance on PowerPoint presentations dumbs down the conversation and does not push teams to think all the way through their topic. As he explained in a 2013 Charlie Rose interview, “When you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences and complete paragraphs, it forces a deeper clarity of thinking.” By contrast, in the typical PowerPoint show, “You get very little information, you get bullet points. This is easy for the presenter, but difficult for the audience.”

> Great leaders (like Jeff Bezos) develop a strong, clear framework; then they constantly apply that framework and articulate it accurately to their team.

> You can see the pattern: the radical transformation of an industry aching for a new delivery model, in this case for cloud-based technology services; the development of a process for driving dramatically lower costs by providing self-service capabilities; and the drive toward scale as a platform business.
