<li>
    <blockquote>“Not me,” you think. “No one would ever call me an egomaniac.” Perhaps you’ve always thought of yourself as a pretty balanced person. But for people with ambitions, talents, drives, and potential to fulfill, ego comes with the territory. Precisely what makes us so promising as thinkers, doers, creatives, and entrepreneurs, what drives us to the top of those fields, makes us vulnerable to this darker side of the psyche. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=180'>180</a>)</blockquote>

<li>
    <blockquote>The performance artist Marina Abramović puts it directly: “If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=215'>215</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>as a warning to his friend Grant, “Be natural and yourself and this glittering flattery will be as the passing breeze of the sea on a warm summer day.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=340'>340</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>In this phase, you must practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability to get out of your own head. Detachment is a sort of natural ego antidote. It’s easy to be emotionally invested and infatuated with your own work. Any and every narcissist can do that. What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=367'>367</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. — LAO TZU (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=382'>382</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>There’s a weak side to each of us, that—like a trade union—isn’t exactly malicious but at the end of the day still wants get as much public credit and attention as it can for doing the least. That side we call ego. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=403'>403</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Kierkegaard warned, “Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it.” And that’s what is so insidious about talk. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=420'>420</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=452'>452</a>)</blockquote>

<li>
    <blockquote>To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=485'>485</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Appearances are deceiving. Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing good work and it doesn’t mean you are worthy of promotion (they call it failing upward in such bureaucracies). Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=495'>495</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>There’s a quip from the historian Will Durant, that a nation is born stoic and dies epicurean. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=502'>502</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The power of being a student is not just that it is an extended period of instruction, it also places the ego and ambition in someone else’s hands. There is a sort of ego ceiling imposed—one knows that he is not better than the “master” he apprentices under. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=565'>565</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>As Shamrock observed, “False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student. That’s what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=580'>580</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold. A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=593'>593</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>“It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows,” Epictetus says. You can’t learn if you think you already know. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=603'>603</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=674'>674</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=702'>702</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=740'>740</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

    <blockquote>for Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for your ideas. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=757'>757</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=773'>773</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>There is an old saying, “Say little, do much.” What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You’d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You’d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You’d have countless new relationships. You’d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=774'>774</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Once we fight this emotional and egotistical impulse, the canvas strategy is easy. The iterations are endless. Maybe it’s coming up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up-and-comers to introduce them to each other. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiencies and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away In other words, discover opportunities to promote their creativity, find outlets and people for collaboration, and eliminate distractions that hinder their progress and focus. It is a rewarding and infinitely scalable power strategy. Consider each one an investment in relationships and in your own development. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=785'>785</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Because if you pick up this mantle once, you’ll see what most people’s egos prevent them from appreciating: the person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=796'>796</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The fighter Bas Rutten sometimes writes the letter R on both his hands before fights—for the word rustig, which means “relax” in Dutch. Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in the ring. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=841'>841</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Instead, you must do nothing. Take it. Eat it until you’re sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=860'>860</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. — ALAN WATTS (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=875'>875</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The novelist Anne Lamott describes that ego story well. “If you are not careful,” she warns young writers, “station KFKD (K-Fucked) will play in your head twenty-four hours a day, nonstop, in stereo.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=918'>918</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Even as adults, we’re susceptible to this fantasy during a harmless walk down the street. We plug in some headphones and all of a sudden there’s a soundtrack. We flip up our jacket collar and consider briefly how cool we must look. We replay the successful meeting we’re heading toward in our head. The crowds part as we pass. We’re fearless warriors, on our way to the top. It’s the opening credits montage. It’s a scene in a novel. It feels good—so much better than those feelings of doubt and fear and normalness—and so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us. That’s ego, baby. What successful people do is curb such flights of fancy. They ignore the temptations that might make them feel important or  skew their perspective. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=937'>937</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>There’s no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=953'>953</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you. — C.S.LEWIS (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=956'>956</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>You don’t have to be Christian to see the wisdom in this. You need only to care about your career to understand that pride—even in real accomplishments—is a distraction and a deluder. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=968'>968</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses. Or in other cases, it tunes up other negative parts of ourselves: sensitivity, a persecution complex, the ability to make everything about us. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1002'>1002</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>“If you can’t swallow your pride, you can’t lead.” He told them that pride would be harder to subdue than a wild lion. He liked the analogy of a mountain. He would say, “Even the tallest mountains have animals that, when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1004'>1004</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work. — PETER DRUCKER (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1027'>1027</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Is it ten thousand hours or twenty thousand hours to mastery? The answer is that it doesn’t matter. There is no end zone. To think of a number is to live in a conditional future. We’re simply talking about a lot of hours—that to get where we want to go isn’t about brilliance, but continual effort. While that’s not a terribly sexy idea, it should be an encouraging one. Because it means it’s all within reach—for all of us, provided we have the constitution and humbleness to be patient and the fortitude to put in the work. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1047'>1047</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>As a young basketball player, Bill Bradley would remind himself, “When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1070'>1070</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you’ve got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1082'>1082</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>It’s more attractive and exciting to see the rebel billionaire, the eccentric, the world renown, and the fame, and think: Oh, how I want that. You do not. Howard Hughes, like so many wealthy people, died in an asylum of his own making. He felt little joy. He enjoyed almost nothing of what he had. Most importantly, he wasted. He wasted so much talent, so much bravery, and so much energy. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1185'>1185</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>“The worst disease which can afflict business executives in their work is not, as popularly supposed, alcoholism; it’s egotism,” Geneen famously said. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1201'>1201</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him. — RALPH WALDO EMERSON (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1218'>1218</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1250'>1250</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Too often, convinced of our own intelligence, we stay in a comfort zone that ensures that we never feel stupid (and are never challenged to learn or reconsider what we know). It obscures from view various weaknesses in our understanding, until eventually it’s too late to change course. This is where the silent toll is taken. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1263'>1263</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1271'>1271</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Why is this? Why can’t businesses change and adapt? A large part of it is because they lost the ability to learn. They stopped being students. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1277'>1277</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>“The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.” He’s saying you don’t make a frontal attack out of ego; instead, you start with a small bet and iteratively scale your ambitions as you go. His other famous piece of advice, “Keep your identity small,” fits well here. Make it about the work and the principles behind it—not about a glorious vision that makes a good headline. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1344'>1344</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>The same goes for us, whatever we do. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here. Because that’s the only thing that will keep us here. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1359'>1359</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>All of us regularly say yes unthinkingly, or out of vague attraction, or out of greed or vanity. Because we can’t say no—because we might miss out on something if we did. We think “yes” will let us accomplish more, when in reality it prevents exactly what we seek. All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1387'>1387</a> / note: Fight club quote, sivers, essentialism book)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>According to Seneca, the Greek word euthymia is one we should think of often: it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. In other words, it’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others. It’s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It’s about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you’re capable of in what you choose. That’s it. No more and no less. (By the way, euthymia means “tranquillity” in English.) (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1407'>1407</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Find out why you’re after what you’re after. Ignore those who mess with your pace. Let them covet what you have, not the other way around. Because that’s independence. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1432'>1432</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important. — BERTRAND RUSSELL (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1435'>1435</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Ego is its own worst enemy. It hurts the ones we love too. Our families and friends suffer for it. So do our customers, fans, and clients. A critic of Napoleon nailed it when remarking: “He despises the nation whose applause he seeks.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1481'>1481</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management of them. — LA ROCHEFOUCAULD (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1504'>1504</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>This is one of the most dangerous ironies of success—it can make us someone we never wanted to be in the first place. The Disease of Me can corrupt the most innocent climb. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1621'>1621</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>According to observers as high up as President Truman, what separated Marshall from nearly everyone else in the military and politics is that “never did General Marshall think about himself.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1627'>1627</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Soccer coach Tony Adams expresses it well. Play for the name on the front of the jersey, he says, and they’ll remember the name on the back. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1639'>1639</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>When we lack a connection to anything larger or bigger than us, it’s like a piece of our soul is gone. Like we’ve detached ourselves from the traditions we hail from, whatever that happens to be (a craft, a sport, a brotherhood or sisterhood, a family). Ego blocks us from the beauty and history in the world. It stands in the way. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1663'>1663</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>We have to actively seek out this cosmic sympathy. There’s the famous Blake poem that opens with “To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour.” That’s what we’re after here. That’s the transcendental experience that makes our petty ego impossible. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1700'>1700</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>That’s what ego does. It clouds the mind precisely when it needs to be clear. Sobriety is a counterbalance, a hangover cure—or better, a prevention method. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1749'>1749</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>They lack artifice, they wear normal clothes. Most successful people are people you’ve never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1769'>1769</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>To borrow from Aristotle again, what’s difficult is to apply the right amount of pressure, at the right time, in the right way, for the right period of time, in the right car, going in the right direction. If we don’t do this, the consequences can be dire. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1788'>1788</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>There is a line from Napoleon, who, like Alexander, died miserably. He said, “Men of great ambition have sought happiness… and have found fame.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1791'>1791</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>At any given moment, there is the chance of failure or setbacks. Bill Walsh says, “Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called ‘failure. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1896'>1896</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>As Goethe once observed, the great failing is “to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth.” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1926'>1926</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Humble and strong people don’t have the same trouble with these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less self-immolation. Instead, there’s stoic—even cheerful—resilience. Pity isn’t necessary. Their identity isn’t threatened. They can get by without constant validation. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1944'>1944</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>Most people know what Malcolm X did after he got out of prison, but they don’t realize or understand how prison made that possible. How a mix of acceptance, humility, and strength powered the transformation. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=1974'>1974</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>It’s far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort—not the results, good or bad—is enough. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2048'>2048</a>)</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
    <blockquote>We need to be compensated. Especially problematic is the fact that, often, we get that. We are praised, we are paid, and we start to assume that the two things always go together. The “expectation hangover” inevitably ensues. There was an unusual encounter between Alexander the Great and the famous Cynic philosopher Diogenes. Allegedly, Alexander approached Diogenes, who was lying down, enjoying the summer air, and stood over him and asked what he, the most powerful man in the world, might be able to do for this notoriously poor man. Diogenes could have asked for anything. What he requested was epic: “Stop blocking my sun.” Even two thousand years later we can feel exactly where in the solar plexus that must have hit Alexander, a man who always wanted to prove how important he was. As the author Robert Louis Stevenson later observed about this meeting, “It is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement.” Well, get ready for it. It will happen. Maybe your parents will never be impressed. Maybe your girlfriend won’t care. Maybe the investor won’t see the numbers. Maybe the audience won’t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can’t let that be what motivates us. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2051'>2051</a>)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Change the definition of success. “Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” “Ambition,” (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2067'>2067</a>)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Do your work. Do it well. Then “let go and let God.” That’s all there needs to be. Recognition and rewards—those are just extra. Rejection, that’s on them, not on us. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2070'>2070</a>)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It’s a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. It’s the sunk cost fallacy. And so we throw good money and good life after bad and end up making everything so much worse. (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2169'>2169</a>)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>When we lose, we have a choice: Are we going to make this a lose-lose situation for ourselves and everyone involved? Or will it be a lose… and then win? (loc: <a href='kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=2218'>2218</a>)</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man,” Seneca once said. Alter that: He who will do anything to avoid failure will almost certainly do something worthy of a failure.

    <blockquote>This is characteristic of how great people think. It’s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else’s.

<li>
    <blockquote>A person who judges himself based on his own standards doesn’t crave the spotlight the same way as someone who lets applause dictate success. A person who can think long term doesn’t pity herself during short-term setbacks. A person who values the team can share credit and subsume his own interests in a way that most others can’t.

    <blockquote>Take inventory for a second. What do you dislike? Whose name fills you with revulsion and rage? Now ask: Have these strong feelings really helped you accomplish anything? Take an even wider inventory. Where has hatred and rage ever really gotten anyone? Especially because almost universally, the traits or behaviors that have pissed us off in other people—their dishonesty, their selfishness, their laziness—are hardly going to work out well for them in the end. Their ego and shortsightedness contains its own punishment. The question we must ask for ourselves is: Are we going to be miserable just because other people are?

<li>
    <blockquote>This obsession with the past, with something that someone did or how things should have been, as much as it hurts, is ego embodied. Everyone else has moved on, but you can’t, because you can’t see anything but your own way. You can’t conceive of accepting that someone could hurt you, deliberately or otherwise. So you hate.
