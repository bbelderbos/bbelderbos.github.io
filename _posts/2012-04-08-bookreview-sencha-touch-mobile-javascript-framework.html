<h3> My review</h3>
<h4> ++ Easy accessible </h4>
<p> The entry level is low, somebody with a general idea about touch devices and having some HTML/CSS skills, preferably also some knowledge of Javascript, can jump in with great ease.</p>
<h4> ++ Clear and concise explanations</h4>
<p> The explanations and code examples were comprehensive and well structured (one caveat with the code, see further down). Especially Chapter 8 was useful: it combined the concepts building a Flickr Finder app - cool.</p>
<h4> ++ Wide range of technologies make it an interesting read</h4>
<p> Apart from Sencha Touch a lot of other technologies are introduced like writing CSS with SASS, the Safari Error console, REST / building an API and AJAX, PhoneGap/ NimbleKit, working in offline mode. I liked this, it gives you some relevant context you need as a developer.</p>
<h4> - - All code == Sencha Touch 1.1.0, you want to use Sencha Touch 2.x !</h4>
<p> Here is where the book lost a bit my appetite. It uses Sencha Touch 1.1.0 and this is not the latest release. Release 2.x is out and contains <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/sencha-touch-2-developer-preview/" target="_blank">important changes</a>. The Sencha Touch 2 Developer Preview was already presented in October last year, yet this book came out if February 2012.  I don't understand it doesn't take a sneak preview at least as the <a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/2011/12/reading-facebook-application-development-with-graph-api-cookbook/" target="_blank">Facebook graph title I reviewed</a> did with the Open Graph that was even fresher when that book was released. </p>
<p>I noted that when I loaded the 2.x library files into the 1.1.0 code examples things started to fail. This demotivated me a bit because I didn't see any use in trying examples of an older release especially knowing that <a href="http://vimeo.com/30296006" target="_blank">performance</a> was the key improvement between 1.x and 2.x. I guess this is inherent to writing a book about any software topic, but I had expected a bit more here, knowing that Packt books are heavily focussed on practical code samples.</p>
<h4> ++ Overall: good book</h4>
<p>That aside, as I already stated the material was presented in a clear and wide scope. It was an interesting and joyful ride to get familiar with the Sencha Touch framework. After reading I can clearly see this is a good approach to mobile web development. I am looking forward to dive into the release 2 documentation soon to actually build something myself. </p>
