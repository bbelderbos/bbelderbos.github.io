<p>With the increased use of <a href="http://fbreadinglist.com/" target="_blank">My Reading List</a> I added some scaffolding to edit and update the books a user added. This was requested by several users as well.</p>

<h3>Effective and beatiful</h3>
<p>This CMS kind of things are quite labor intensive, and you usually want it to be user friendly. A great plugin that answers both is <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable" target="_blank">jeditable</a> which allows you to edit in place after clicking the element. It works in a wide variety of cases, especially the select box popping out is neat.</p>
<h3>How does it work</h3>
<p>The technique is rather simple: you point to a server side script that gets the variables POST-ed in id/value pairs. It's best to check out the <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable" target="_blank">plugin's page</a> and start playing with the <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html" target="_blank">demo page</a></p>
