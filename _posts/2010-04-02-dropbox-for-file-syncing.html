<p>And now something totally different ..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dropbox_logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67" title="dropbox_logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dropbox_logo.png" alt="" width="253" height="86" /></a>I rediscovered this cool tool listening to the <a title="sitepoint podcast episode 32" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/10/18/podcast-32-everything-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Sitepoint podcast</a>. This is a great free app that gives you 2g of central storage. Of course you have to accept your files will be hosted on Dropbox' server (same trust you grant when using google services), but it is quite handy for personal pdfs, notes etc.</p>
<p>Old news for some of you, what was new for me though were these two cool features:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have more systemsÂ  you sync files much faster thanks to <a title="lan syncing" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/137" target="_blank">LAN syncing</a></li>
<li>Plugin for use on your ipod/iphone - and it quite smart: it lets you directly read your docs online but only downloads them to your ipod if you star them as "favorite", so that prevents Dropbox from eating up precious MBs on your device (I found this info on the <a title="dropbox faq mobile devices" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/116" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>)</li>
</ol>
