<p>A book, article or any piece read without proper underlining or note taking (marginalia) might as well been unread at all. Unfortunately I found out late, fortunately it is never too late to improve. In this post a couple of tools to better retain info, and some tricks to get more reading done.</p>

<h3>Note taking</h3>

<p><a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> is probably my most important tool (as it is for many writers). Platform independent it works really well going everywhere (Mac at home, Android anywhere). It's indexing is superb (photos/scans included), tagging is powerful and you can easily chat/share with friends. I use the <a href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/">Web Clipper</a> browser extension for desktop, <a href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/article/23193638">adding stuff on Android</a> is very easy too.</p>
<p>The importance of having my highlights and notes in Evernote is twofold: as an aid in writing the next article and to reread the essentials of for example a book (<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/21/charles-poliquin/">Charles Poliquin pointed out</a> this leads to a much higher retention of the material).</p>

<h3>Reading tools (Kindle centered)</h3>

<p>For years now <a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/2012/01/why-the-kindle-is-my-number-one-reading-device/">Kindle is my main reading device</a>. The <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Amazon_Kindle#/Kindle_Paperwhite_.281st_generation.29">Paperwhite technology</a> is awesome: adjusting light for any light intensity. Ever tried to read on an iPad in the Sun? Not fun. Or tried to fall asleep after staring too long at a smart phone screen? Hard! Kindle solves these problems.</p>
<p>I like the Amazon infrastructure. You can get almost any book in seconds, usually for a reasonable price. For other materials <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle">Send to Kindle</a> is great: it lets you convert and deliver most formats to your device, with an option to store in their cloud. Notes, highlights and reading position are nicely synced  across devices. I know, Apple iBooks does this too, I just like the Amazon way better.</p>
<p>For (common) epub to (Kindle) mobi conversion I use open source app <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a>.</p>
<p>One caveat is that Amazon only lets you export highlights from Amazon purchased books. You can use the <a href="http://www.norbauer.com/bookcision/">Bookcision bookmarklet</a> for this. For other books and materials on your kindle you need to copy (USB) the My Clippings.txt file stored on your Kindle. I use <a href="https://clippings.io">clippings.io</a> to import, organize and export my Kindle notes to Evernote. Although I need to go through this manual process from time to time, I rest assured that every new highlight and note I make will eventually be available (indexed) in Evernote.</p>
<h3>Batch read articles</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> for this purpose. I mostly consume books, but there are blogs/articles I should digest. Pocket's <a href="http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/topics/209716-pocket-browser-extensions/articles">browser extension</a> makes it easy to add articles (with a button in the upper bar or under the right-click menu, latter being useful on social media to bookmark articles without leaving the site). I also get a weekly curated recommendation email titled “We’ve found a few things you can save to Pocket” which often leads to serendipitious reading. In a similar trend they recently started the <a href="https://getpocket.com/blog/2015/08/introducing-recommendations-the-most-interesting-articles-and-videos-you-might-have-missed/">recommendations</a> feature.</p>

<h3>Learn via Audio</h3>
<p>Listen to podcasts and audiobooks: this is a great way of complementing the reading and can be multitasked with doing aerobics, dish washing, driving ("turn your car into an university on wheels" <a href="http://continuouslyimprovingyou.com/university-on-wheels/" target="_blank">said Brian Tracey</a>) and the like. <a href="http://audible.com">Audible</a> is a great service, and there are just too many great Podcasts: one I find continuously inspiring is the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/">Tim Ferriss show</a> (deconstruction of skillsets of high performers, wide variety of guests). This podcast recommends <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcode History</a>, but I still have to check it out. I also should mention <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED talks</a> as an important source of inspiration and wisdom.</p>

<h3>Read in small chunks </h3>

<p>I am not a fast reader, but there is a lot of idle time you can use to get some of it done: waiting in line, cardio, lunch, etc. Most avid readers take a book with them everywhere they go, with reading devices/apps weight and size is not an issue anymore. In the article <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/06/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/" target="_blank">How to read more,</a> Ryan Holiday states that reading should become a default, a reflex, not something you do as an activity. True: once you make this mind shift, you consume a lot more. Abandoning TV is also highly recommended (although I am always in favor of watching good movies).</p>

<h3>Invest the time</h3>
<p>Not only do you turn into a better reader by reading a lot, Stephen King <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1404-if-you-don-t-have-time-to-read-you-don-t-have" target="_blank">said</a> that "if you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that" (again from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Writing-Anniversary-Edition-Memoir/dp/1439156816/?tag=bobbeld-20" target="_blank">On Writing</a>)</p>
