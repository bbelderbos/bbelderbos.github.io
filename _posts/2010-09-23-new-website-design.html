<p>It always takes some time to accept changes, especially when it concerns your website, but  I am happy I did it. I used the powerful <a title="Thematic Theme Framework" rel="designer" href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/"> Thematic Theme Framework</a> on top of <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>.  Now I have a clean integrating of both my blog and my design  work (before it were two different websites).  As I blog more often now, I wanted to emphasize that part in the new  design.</p>
<p>Wordpress, the popular CMS / blogging software, allows to make customized pages. Together with the ease of maintaining a blog, it is a tool I really have become to appreciate.</p>
<p>My Reading List and Latest Bookmarks sections I moved to the cloud. For bookmarks you can visit my <a href="http://delicious.com/bobbelderbos" target="_blank">delicious page</a> and I use <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/opensocialInstallation/preview?_ch_panel_id=1&amp;_applicationId=1700" target="_blank">Amazon reading list provided by Linkedin</a> to share interesting books. I like minimalism in design, it's stresses the essential</p>
<p>From my experience I knew that changing an existing design would take  more time and wouldn't guarantee a 100% satisfactory result, so I  revamped my site from scratch. There is also a better  integration with social media services, thanks to share buttons (Wordpress plugins and Addthis)</p>
<p>Next post I will catch up with some recent web spotlights.</p>
