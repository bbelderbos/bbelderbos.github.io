<p>I just made a new avatar, but I only used Photoshop to shave off the grey background to save it as a png with transparent background. A quick post to show you how ...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Here is the How </h3>
<ul>
<li>1. I made a screenshot of part of the background image of <a href="http://exploringtheweb.net" target="_blank">Exploring the web</a></li>
<li>2. I wanted to have BB (Bob Belderbos) on top of that so I set up a h1 element with a span wrapped inside (for the matter of this exercise any elements would do because I am about to style them with CSS)</li>
<li>3. I gave h1 the background of the towers and all styles (span could inherit).</li>
<li>4. I used the span (child) tag for some specific styles: 
<p>a. BB to be transparent =&gt; <em>opacity: .7;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>b. tweak a bit the positioning =&gt; <em>position: relative; top: 0px; right: 15px; </em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why this exercise?</h3>
<p>Usually this goes as quick with Photoshop but I wanted to use the Limelight Google font (font of the headers on this blog) and I was too lazy to import it into Photoshop.</p>
<p>I think the conclusion is: CSS(3) is very versatile to quickly apply styles to your designs. It's one of the easiest languages to learn, and I use it for mockups often (much more than Photoshop) due to its flexibility</p>
