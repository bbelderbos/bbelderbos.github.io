<p>As you can see at the right side, I created a widget with recent books I have read/ am reading/ want to read. This data is fetched from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=190383630995551" target="_blank">My Reading List</a>, a Facebook App I created to integrate your reading into Facebook</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Why a widget?</h3>
<p>My first take was the complete app page in an iframe but it is cluttered (images below). Instead I wrote a widget page to get the last 4 to 6 titles from the My Reading List database dynamically. It's much cleaner now. Below it you can click to see all titles or to join the App. I always loved how you could integrate your Amazon reading list into Linkedin but wanted to have it on my blog + with Facebook integration&nbsp; :)</p>
<h3>Want your own?</h3>
<p>You can! Just <a href="http://fbreadinglist.com/" target="_blank">join My Reading List</a> and start adding books. You then put an iframe on your site and point to <a href="http://fbreadinglist.com/widget.php?id=&lt;your_fb_id&gt;">http://fbreadinglist.com/widget.php?id=&lt;your_fb_id&gt;</a></p>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>As you can see the original widget was black because I published it on <a href="http://exploringtheweb.net" target="_blank">Exploring the web</a> which has a dark theme. I just made a white version which you see used on this blog:<br />
<a href="http://fbreadinglist.com/widget_white.php?id=&lt;your_fb_id&gt;">http://fbreadinglist.com/widget_white.php?id=&lt;your_fb_id&gt;</a></p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>First approach = cluttered: </h4>

<h4>Now: widget = better</h4>
<p>When you hover over the book thumbs, you see the title, review, date. Clicking the thumb gets you to the My Reading List book page with Facebook comment box. I might wrap this in a Wordpress plugin one day.</p>
