<p>This week is quite a busy one so far, but as every week my (web) highlights. Less news, more tools &amp; tips this time:<br />
1. google reader, 2. import photos from iphone, 3. IE/Chrome market share, 4. bug isolation, 5. HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/spotlights_w40.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-465 alignleft" style="margin: 5px 30px 5px 0;" title="spotlights_w40" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/spotlights_w40.png" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a>1. Google Reader</h3>
<p>First of all I discovered Google Reader and the power of subscribing to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/what-is-rss/" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a>. It was kind of an "aha" moment. You just open your favorite RSS Reader, in my case <a href="https://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">google reader</a> and you have your feeds at the left side and it reads like a news  paper, but more compact, because the articles display only their title,  like (g)mail. All interesting stuff is now centered in one place and I  don't have to receive blog subscription emails or scroll through endless  twitter updates of followers. It's way more efficient to read news!</p>
<p>Google reader is neat just as gmail and other google apps. You can share, mail, tagg, like posts, you can even search for similar feeds:</p>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-02-at-12.31.03-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-458" title="add more feeds" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-shot-2010-10-02-at-12.31.03-PM.png" alt="add more feeds" width="624" height="327" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Import photos from iPhone</h3>
<p>I had way too many photos on my iphone, time to backup! But how to get them off the iphone? Not via itunes it seems :(</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_459" align="alignnone" width="668" caption="itunes offer you one-way syncing"]<a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photos.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-459" title="sync photos itunes" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photos.png" alt="sync photos itunes" width="668" height="159" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>You can mail various photos, but nothing to sync the whole bunch to a cloud service like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">dropbox</a>, . So you reach out to finder/ windows explorer but you can't see the device. On Mac you can use iPhoto but I am not always a fan of how it organizes my photos and I use Canon software to manage my photo. Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/iphone-hardware-accessories/211333-photos-iphone-3gs-imac.html" target="_blank">this post</a> and problem fixed: use Image Capture (native OS app) and voila photos are on my desktop now :D</p>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-11.05.09-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-460" title="Screen shot 2010-10-06 at 11.05.09 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-11.05.09-PM.png" alt="" width="736" height="90" /></a></p>
<p>OK that is for mac, for Windows there are similar ways, see <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2548/iphone_transfer_pictures_from_iphone_to_xp/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h3>3. IE going down, Chrome rising</h3>
<p>Third (stop chuckling some designers out there ..) <a href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2010/10/07/ie-market-share-falls-below-50/" target="_blank">IE Market Share Falls Below 50%</a>. That in itself is not the good news, if you look at the table we see that "<em>7.5% of IE6 users switched browser in the past month" </em>- that is the <strong>great</strong> news and stresses the fact that IE6 becomes less and less important and saves us designers some early grey hairs ;)<br />
Also note Google’s Chrome has a <strong>11.52%</strong> share and increasing: quite spectacular! Using this browser for some time now I say it is no less than deserved.</p>

4. How to isolate a bug</h3>
<p>Ok not necessarily web related, but wanted to mention <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/10/error-reports-how-to-isolate-a.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+readwriteweb+%28ReadWriteWeb%29" target="_blank">this interesting article</a> with some tips every troubleshooter would recognize. Finally "<em>isolating bugs can be something of an art</em>" and we might loose a lot of time if we are not methodical here. So this is a good start:<br />
1. What is the Error Message?<br />
2. Expected vs Actual Results<br />
3. Steps to Reproduce the problem<br />
4. What's the URL (generic: are transmitter and receiver talking about the same thing?)<br />
5. Browser Version and Settings (generic: compatibility software components, specific configurations, context)</p>
<h3><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/bug_no_400.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-463 alignleft" style="margin: 5px 30px;" title="bug_no_400" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bug_no_400-300x300.png" alt="" width="162" height="162" /></a></h3>
<p>This list is not complete, but as troubleshooting is part of everybody's  job, especially when we get stuck and loose valuable time, it can be a  big time saver to go down a list of fixed items. It depends the area you  are troubleshooting in, but cut out 95% at the start solves 90% of the  problems and for the not so straightforward stuff it makes trial and  error more efficient.</p>

5.HTML5 Boilerplate</h3>
<p>Last but not least a profound framework to start off your next web project: <a title="Permanent Link to Professional Base Template For HTML5-CSS3 Projects: HTML5 ★ Boilerplate" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.greepit.com/2010/08/professional-base-template-for-html5-css3-projects-html5boilerplate/" target="_blank">Professional Base Template For HTML5-CSS3 Projects: HTML5 ★ Boilerplate</a>: "HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional badass's base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-proof site." I heard about it some time ago in the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/podcast/" target="_blank">sitepoint podcast</a>: it's at times geeky but definitely <a rel="bookmark" href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">a useful resource for every designer out there</a></p>
