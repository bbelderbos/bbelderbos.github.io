<p>Wednesday, time for this week's web spotlights.</p>
<h3>1. Itunes 10, ping(fm) and iphone ringtones</h3>
<p>There were some complaints about the new itunes icon (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/07/itunes-10-icon/" target="_blank">even new ones got designed</a>) but I like it. Also the fact that the new icons within itunes 10 are colorless, doesn't really bother me. I don't notice any significant change, apart from the album artworks that are more economically positioned (and intelligently displayed).</p>
<p>More important news was <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/" target="_blank">ping</a>, the new social media of Apple/iTunes. I set up my account, but so far I find it very limited and it's not really a social media in the way twitter or facebook is. The button to "like" a song is a bit hidden and you can only like/post music from the itunes store. You cannot import contacts from a list, only individual email invitations or you follow people that already signed up (most of my favorite artists didn't).<br />
I am not sure what Apple wants to achieve with this but my first impression is that social media is not their cup of tea. From the tight integration with the iTunes Store it seems obvious that there are commercial interests at play here.</p>
<p><a href="http://ping.fm/" target="_blank">Ping.fm</a> profited from the new hype cause they turned up in google when people searched for Apple's new service. Ping.fm is a great service: you simply sign up and grant access to the social networks you regularly post to. Then you can post once, and publish to "your everywhere". I mainly use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pingpressfm/" target="_blank">WP plugin</a>: when I publish this post it will "ping" all my social media automatically :D</p>
<p>Last thing about Apple, a quick howto: iPhone doesn't let you grab a song from your music library and convert it to a ringtone. With a Nokia ExpressMusic this is quite easy, but for the Apple device I needed to <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2160460_custom-iphone-ringtones-free.html" target="_blank">manually create some ringtones</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Apture plugin</h3>
<p>As you scroll down you should have noticed the bar sliding in from above: that is <a href="http://www.apture.com/" target="_blank">Apture</a>. It is another way that people can share your content via social media. Moreover, you can search for more content doubleclicking any word or selection, so you can stay comfortably at the page you are reading (how seldom these days ;) )<br />
I really appreciate these plugins because it spreads the word and make use of the existing power of social media. My twitter stream is full of interesting news that gets pushed to me, instead of having to search for it myself.</p>
<p>You can also get the <a href="http://apture.com/extension/welcome/" target="_blank">extension</a> for firefox, safari or chrome to be able to use the Apture bar on any site by pressing Control+Shift+L</p>
<p>Btw, their support is really good. I mailed them two times with a question/feedback and I got an answer almost immediately.<br />

<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13926970&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13926970&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Evernote</span></a> (again)</h3>
<p>Yes again (sorry) .. it is really is my no 1. note-taking app now.<br />
You can clip it in the top of your OS window like this:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_221" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="evernote clipped in your OS"]<a href="http://www.bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-08-at-2.44.38-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-221  " title="evernote clipped in your OS" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-shot-2010-09-08-at-2.44.38-PM-300x24.png" alt="evernote clipped in your OS" width="300" height="24" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>.. and when you copy something you can directly paste it to a new note with ^+cmd+N (or the first option under the Evernote icon), really efficient way to keep notes. For example I pasted a lot of terminal output when I was playing with ruby on rails last weekend: select all, single click paste to new note, save, done. And as I have Evernote on my iPhone as well, I have my notes always at hand.</p>
<p>It gets better: Evernote can even reads scanned notes - quite cool!</p>

<h3>4. CSS galleries.</h3>
<p>My site design was featured in two CSS galleries: <a href="http://www.dezinecss.co.uk/sites/bob-belderbos/" target="_blank">deZinecss</a> and <a href="http://cssnack.com/2010/08/bob-belderbos/" target="_blank">cssnack</a></p>

<p>The problem with today's social media literature is that it becomes obsolete almost instantly! I still prefer books over api documentation that is sometimes cryptic and leaves you with questions. Good news for social media api lovers. This books seems to deal with all and it is brand new/ up2date (publish date: 15th of August).</p>
<p>** Tip: if you subscribe to <a href="http://twitter.com/InformIT" target="_blank">informIT</a> you get a 35% discount on your first purchase so I got the ebook for a quite attractive price ;)</p>
<p>OK.. going back to my interesting read now :D</p>
