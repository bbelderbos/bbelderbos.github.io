<p> I finished reading <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpmysql5/" target="_blank">PHP & MYSQL Novice to Ninja</a> and I recommend it for beginners and intermediate learners of PHP. It is easy to digest, teaches best practices and the code is clean and usable.</p>

<p> Disclaimer: contrary to other book reviews, I did not get a copy for this one. As I found this a remarkable PHP book, I wanted to dedicate a blog post to it.</p>
<p> The author probably can describe best what kind of book this is (<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpmysql5/" target="_blank">source</a>): " ... Just as PHP and MySQL have grown from the young upstarts of the web development world into mature, stable platforms for billion-dollar businesses, this book that I've been writing again and again for over a decade has grown up â€¦ It's time to write PHP like the big kids do ...".</p>
<p> Why is this such a good starter for learning PHP?</p>
<ul>
<li> This is the 5th edition of what has become a best-seller book on PHP. Each edition has grown in handling more recent PHP versions and ways PHP is used nowadays. It uses a clean MVC (model-view-controller) structure seperating PHP controlling code from HTML view templates. It attacks common security pitfalls and presents the concepts in a logical order. From reading the 4th and 5th editions I can attest that it is a well crafted book.</li>
<li> Beginnings of OOP: the database code has been rewritten in this edition to use <a href="http://php.net/manual/es/book.pdo.php" target="_blank">PDO</a> (PHP Data Objects API) which professional PHP developers should use. PDO is like JDBC (Java) or DBI (Perl). It provides a data-access abstraction layer which makes changing from one database server to another easy. PDO works with prepared statements which protect you from SQL-injection attacks. Required is a <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php" target="_blank">database-specific PDO driver</a> ... but I get sidetracked ... ;)</li>
<li> Code best practices: apart from PDO, we see try/catch blocks, MVC architecture, eye for security practices (for example the use of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-uploaded-file.php" target="_blank">is_uploaded_file</a> when dealing with file upload forms) and more</li>
<li> I found the database chapters amazing. Again clear, concise, and teach good practices in design. It is mixed in with the PHP chapters: ch2 gives you some basics about mysql, ch5 explains Relational Database Design, ch6-9 uses it heavily in the building of the internet joke database CMS, ch10 - MySQL Administration and ch11 - Advanced SQL Queries, teach more advanced topics. Plus 3 appendices with MySQL reference material. Even if you are going to use another database product then MySQL, the database intro alone provided in this book is worth spending the money.</li>
<li> Very practical: this book shows you how to build your first dynamic database driven website, step by step. The examples are very clear. I got some years of experience now so the first 100 or so pages I just gazed over, but the project code still had good insights for me. So even having the basics, this can still be a useful reference to do things the right way.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sitepoint podcast <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-podcast-161-the-return-of-the-yank-with-kevin-yank/" target="_blank">interviewed the author</a> some months back about this new 5th edition. To go deeper, I think <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phppro1/" target="_blank">PHP Master</a> might be a good sequel (I have to read it yet). It explains more advanced topics like OOP, testing, security and APIs.</p>
