<p>I just stumbled upon a new plugin to add a Google+ Widget to your blog, allowing readers to add you directly to their circles. I am still playing with Google+, but my impressions up until now are very positive. <!--more--></p>
<h4>Update 31.08.11</h4>
<p><b>I decluttered my blog and I have to admit I prefer just a g+ icon under which I have under "Places". The number of circles I am in is really not important to me, and this way I save in less JS code. Of course the plugin looks very nice in a sidebar, but mine got just to cluttered.</b></p>
<hr />
<p>See <a title="plugin's page" href="http://plusdevs.com/google-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">http://plusdevs.com/google-wordpress-plugin/</a><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1311423821.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1025" title="1311423821" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1311423821.png" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a> for more instructions: basically you download/upload the zipfile to your Wordpress blog, unpack it and activate it in your wp-admin.</p>
<p>Then you drag the GoogleCard to your sidebar in the WP Widget page and you fill in your Google+ ID (something like 106057741186141812269, the number you see after plus.google.com when in your profile's page). You can also put a customized title.</p>
<p>Done! See the sidebar of this blog. You can add me to share interesting web related stuff, I think it will be my most active topic on the new social network.</p>
<h3>Waiting ...</h3>
<p>Waiting for more fun with the Google+ API ! For now <a title="sign up for future use of the google+ api" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6518150/is-there-already-a-google-api" target="_blank">I could only sign up to get notified</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to get a post out soon about Google+, it seems to really add value to Twitter and Facebook.</p>
