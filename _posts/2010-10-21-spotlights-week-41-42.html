<p><a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> is a new photo sharing service for Iphone. It integrates with social   media and let's you adjust photos with filters that give them a really   nice effect. You can follow other people and like/comment their photos. This app rocks: <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/Techcrunch/%7E3/dA26orLKYXQ/" target="_blank"><strong>Instagram</strong> Captures 100,000 Mobile Photo Addicts In Less Than A Week</a></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/15733908">This interesting webinar</a> shows how you can use Facebook for your business. I can recommend it to everybody who wants to benefit from the biggest social media fish. A fanpage for example is a very strong way to enforce your brand. This video shows some important do's and dont's.</p>
<p>More Facebook: <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=437439852130" target="_blank">Skype integrates Facebook</a> so you can call your Facebook friends and update your feed within skype. Only Windows users can use this service for now, Mac users, keep an eye on <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/mac/" target="_blank">this page</a>. <a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/spotlights41-421.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-515 alignright" style="margin: 20px;" title="Spotlights week 41-42" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/spotlights41-421.jpg" alt="Spotlights week 41-42" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday a new book came out by Andy Clarke, one of my favorite web designers / CSS gurus. According to <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/books/hardboiled-web-design" target="_blank">the website</a> it is not yet another HTML5/CSS3 book: "<em>Hardboiled Web Design is  different. Itâ€™s for people who want to understand why, when and how to  use the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technologies in their everyday work.</em>" Having read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transcending-CSS-Fine-Art-Design/dp/0321410971" target="_blank">Transcending CSS</a> of the same author, my expectations are high.</p>
<p>Some time ago Gmail made it possible  to call landline and mobile phones. Wouldn't it be cool to add  a Google Voice call widget inside your HTML email? Well, I stumbled  upon <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/blog/adding-a-google-voice-call-widget-to-your-email/" target="_blank">this cool MailChimp blog post</a>. Looks quite nice, but I couldn't see the "Add a new call widget" so far. Maybe you have to add some credit first. An alternative is to link to Skype: make a link "skype:&lt;your_username&gt;?add" and your browser will go to Skype to add you as contact.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" target="_blank">The new MacBook Air is out</a>! It's really slick, thinner, lighter and.. more affordable (starting at 999). Check out this <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/155067/2010/10/firstlook_10inch_air.html" target="_blank">honest review</a> and of course <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/#macbook-air-video" target="_blank">Apple's cool intro video</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing magazine</a> is one of my favorite news blogs about web design/development. I found <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/18/common-security-mistakes-in-web-applications/" target="_blank">this article</a> an interesting read about security mistakes in web applications. For PHP I found a similar article on <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/" target="_blank">Sitepoint</a> (another favorite site): <a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/php-security-blunders" target="_blank">php security blunders</a></p>
