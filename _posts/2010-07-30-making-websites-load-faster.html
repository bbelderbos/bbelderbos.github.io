<p>Today there are still limits in downloading files from the web server to the local browser.</p>
<p>Some tips:</p>
<p>a- as the browser can only make a limited number of requests at one time you have to limit them.<br />
put all JS and CSS together in less files possible.</p>
<p>b- compress the code. this is a slight saving, but every kb helps especially if you consider the cost of bandwidth on a multi-user app</p>
<p>c- use sprites combining multiple images into a single image.<br />
I still have to experiment with this option</p>
<p>d- put javascript files at the bottom; you will see the html/css/images much faster</p>
<p>e- download the yslow plugin for firefox to test and check some other features.</p>
