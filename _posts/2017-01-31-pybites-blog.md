The last 5-and-a-half weeks have been Python on steroids. [Julian]((http://techmoneykids.com)) and myself launched a new blog where we share our Python learning. A post on my learning so far.

<h3>Enter PyBites</h3>

On [PyBites](http://pybit.es) we do code challenges, publish tutorials and a weekly tweet digests of Python-related news. We have some good momentum going on and above all, we're learning and sharing a lot of Python this way.

<h3>A few things I have learned so far</h3>

* Quality matters, but so does quantity. Programming requires practice, a lot of it (as Schwarzenegger says: "you have to do the reps"). If I look at [our archive](http://pybit.es/pages/archives.html) I think we do our reps ;)

* Community. Weekly code challenges are great for learning, teaching and mentoring. This initiative got quite some traction [on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13352447) and [Github](https://github.com/pybites/challenges). We enjoy building a community of Pythonistas eager to learn with us.

* When you have to blog (explain) something you learn much more. Apart from the code challenges, I learned a lot from explaining [deque](http://pybit.es/collections-deque.html), [pep8](http://pybit.es/pep8.html), [itertools](http://pybit.es/itertools-examples.html), [oop](http://pybit.es/oop-primer.html) and [Python's data model](http://pybit.es/python-data-model.html).

* This blog runs on Jekyll and I think static site generators are awesome. That's why we went with Pelican (Python!) for PyBites. We [learned a lot](http://pybit.es/install-me.html) in the process and managing content on Github as a team is really convenient.

* Jupyter notebooks are a great learning tool. This week we found a [great plugin](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb) to embed them in our posts (examples [here](http://pybit.es/oop-primer.html) and [here](http://pybit.es/python-data-model.html)).

* Maybe most important of all, we have a lot of fun in the process. PyBites has been a long time coming for us. The difference in our background and experience should make PyBites approachable to all. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do creating it.
