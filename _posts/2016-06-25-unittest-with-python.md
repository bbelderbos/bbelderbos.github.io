title: Writing tests in Python with unittest and mock
comments: True
summary: In this post I take an existing script and write unit tests for it. This was a good exercise to grasp some aspects of writing tests. It even led to catching a bug and doing a couple of refactorings.

In this post I take an existing script and write unit tests for it. This exercise got me a good grasp of testing code, it even led to catching a bug and doing a couple of small refactorings. I also learned to use mock to test the Twitter API (tweepy). 

Writing tests after code is better than no tests at all, however I am currently learning more TDD (test driven development) which dictates that you write your tests first (hence 'drive' your design). I will do another video soon about how this changes the way you code ...
