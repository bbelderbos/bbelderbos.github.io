<p>Hello everybody. Today I am releasing my site. Thanks for checking it  out.</p>
<p>This site is about web design: the sites I make and the web  techniques I am learning about. The web is a quickly evolving place,  sometimes it is hard to keep up with the many new technologies. However,  if you're eager to learn, you'll find out it is not that difficult to  make good websites that are fast, simple and creative.</p>
<p>The key  is defining clear targets at the start and regularly match them against  your progress. The endgame is equally important: have all best practices  been applied? Does everything work as expected?</p>
<p>It is important  to use <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>: first the structure /  markup (xhtml), then the presentation (css) and at last some javascript  to enhance the usability. It doesn't only save time, it guarantees clean  web designs!</p>
<p>My goal for 2010: keep on making <strong>beautiful web sites which are  fast, creative and reliable</strong></p>
<p>Happy designing!<br />
Bob</p>
