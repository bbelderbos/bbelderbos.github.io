<p>With so much info these days, one needs to organize. That's where Read It Later comes into play: save what you want to read and have easy access to it, anytime and anywhere. Read your articles text-only and even offline. In this post "the app" to use to organize your reading.<!--more--></p>
<h3>To be in sync</h3>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/readitlater.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-837 alignright" title="read it later app" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/readitlater.png" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a>Like <a title="my post on dropbox" href="http://bobbelderbos.com/2010/04/dropbox-for-file-syncing/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, <a title="read it later homepage" href="http://readitlaterlist.com/" target="_blank">Read It Later</a> is a cloud service that is extremely useful to sync content across devices. Typically in the evening I go through my twitter and facebook streams, find some interesting articles, but I don't have time to read them.<br />
So you are faced with a dilemma: shall I just ignore this stuff, "favorite" them in twitter (while this is improper use of "favorites"), bookmark the links to a service called delicious (while I am not sure the article deserves to be bookmarked), copy the URLs to a text file or email the link to myself (which is the worst option)?<br />
For me none of these options were really even close to an ideal solution. So I created a new account at Read it Later and I have a feeling I read more because I bundle the blogs and articles together and read them at specific intervals.</p>
<h3>Mobile device</h3>
<p>After you have created your account, if you have a mobile device, you probably want to install the app on it as well. For example for the iPhone you can do this <a title="iphone readitlater app" href="http://readitlaterlist.com/iphone/" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally you can configure your browser and twitter to use Read It Later.</p>
<h3><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/readitlater_homepage.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842" title="readitlater homepage" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/readitlater_homepage.png" alt="" width="550" height="193" /></a></h3>
<h3>Firefox plugin</h3>
<p>You can add Read It Later to Firefox <a title="read it later firefox plugin" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7661/" target="_blank">from this page</a> and from the URL bar you can easily add links to your list clicking the yellow "greater than" icon:</p>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/easybookmark.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844" title="easy bookmark" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/easybookmark.png" alt="" width="97" height="34" /></a></p>
<p>You can also use alt +W or right-click + "Read this page later". In the App settings in Firefox Addons, there is a wide range of settings, it's broader than I thought..</p>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/readitlater_options.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845" title="readitlater_options" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/readitlater_options.png" alt="" width="599" height="370" /></a></p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p><a title="twitter for iphone app" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8" target="_blank">Twitter for iphone</a> lets you integrate you Read It Later account so that you can save links with one touch. Read It Later is integrated in <a title="read it later is integrated in many apps" href="http://readitlaterlist.com/apps/" target="_blank">lot of other apps</a>. I find it particularly handy with Twitter where there is an infinity of articles. I typically scan the tweets and save some interesting articles for later reading. Read It Later is really helpful here.</p>
<h3>Other advantages</h3>
<p>-Read It Later has offline mode so no internet connection is required. You can download the articles when online and read them offline.</p>
<p>-Another great advantage is that you might have a better reading experience. With the text-only toggle you can read the article without distracting images and ads. It's similar to <a title="readability, another great plugin to declutter" href="https://www.readability.com/" target="_blank">readability</a>, another great app to help you "de-clutter" your reading.</p>
<p><a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/betterreading.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839" title="a better reading experience" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/betterreading.png" alt="" width="580" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>-You can share to other networks, but you need the Pro version for that. I didn't try it so far.</p>
<p>-As shown above: lot of options and customizations. There is even an API to bring Read It Later to your own apps!</p>
<h3>What about you?</h3>
<p>Are you using Read It Later, or you prefer alternatives like <a title="instapaper homepage" href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>? If so, why?<br />
Or do you use something that is even better?<br />
Let me know ..</p>
