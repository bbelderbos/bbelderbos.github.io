* First obvious thing is to code. A lot. I was reminded of this again reading this [great post](https://medium.com/swlh/what-happened-after-i-left-the-best-job-in-the-world-to-become-an-engineer-ee06caca7db2#.l0jw2no7d) this morning:

        wakeUp();

        workOut();

        var currentHour = new Date().getHours();

        var bedtimeHour = 22;

        while(currentHour < bedtimeHour) {
          code();
          currentHour = new Date().getHours();
        };

    Source: [myLife.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/iam-peekay/cd695c6278536dd7180342bb97c937f3/raw/93629889af603b40a1125b488227dd356864a89e/myLife.js). I bought an [ABC t-shirt](http://bobbelderbos.com/public/bob_whoami.png) to remind myself of this (well, also because I like Glengarry Glen Ross lol). Wether the [10,000-Hour Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) is true or not, with practice comes skill, and generally the more (challenged) practice the more skills.

* Build side projects. For example I was learning [some new Python tricks and idioms](http://bobbelderbos.com/2016/06/python-tips/) reading the Python Cookbook, but it was not until using it that this stuff sunk in. For example I needed nested defaultdicts and some other things I had to reach out to StackOverflow for. Books are a good foundation, but skill comes from getting your hands dirty. It's then that exceptions happen and you have to become creative solving things, actually 'using' the software you are learning. Yesterday for example [I wrote a Twitter bot](http://bobbelderbos.com/2016/06/twitter-bot/). I was already familiar with the concept, however I still learned new things: the requests module, writing your own exceptions, the logging module, a good way to hide credentials on a github repo, etc. Also something might work locally but deploy it to your server ... So practice, practice, practice! Aim everyday to become an improved version of your yesterday's YOU.

* Read the passionate programmer. I made some notes [here](http://bobbelderbos.com/2011/04/advance-career-read-passionate-programmer/). [The Developer's code](https://www.amazon.com/Developers-Code-Ka-Wai-Cheung/dp/1934356794/) is also a great read. Books to reread from time to time.

* Share you learning. Start a blog. It has myriad of advantages. [Technical blogging](http://bobbelderbos.com/2012/06/great-book-on-technical-blogging/) is a great resource. I can also recommend [Show your work](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered/dp/076117897X/). 

* Become a time management freak. One thing [John Sonmez](http://simpleprogrammer.com) recommends in [Soft Skills](https://www.manning.com/books/soft-skills) is keeping a log of time spent. We loose a lot of time on trivia especially in this high interrupt social media society we live in. I am going to give this one a try ...

* Muscles need stimulation to grow, equally a software developer needs constant challenge to stretch to new levels. The mentioned 10,000-Hour Rule is only as good as you find yourself new challenges!

> Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone." - Rashedur Ryan Rahman. 

* Use idle time for rest, but it never hurts to listen to podcasts or do some video courses. Any success starts with a thought, and feeding your mind with good ideas can have surprising effects. I devour podcasts on my walks.

* Collaborate with other developers (and do code reviews). it is not until you have to explain your code, or [make it maintainable/ extensible](http://bobbelderbos.com/2016/03/building-maintainable-software/), that you really start thinking about the underlying design. Another benefit of blogging: generally when you can explain your skill to another person you mastered it, without it, not so sure. 

* Become a better writer. Apart from an essential skill in all arenas of life, clear writing has a lot in common with good coding. 

* Try new things. I have been using Python a lot which I love, but there are a lot of other good languages out there. I hear a lot about Machine Learning, AI, interesting to check out. Coding in PHP? Try Django, or try full stack JS. You get the point. Even within a language you already use you can check out specific stuff like (in Python's case) collections, data science modules like Pandas, functional programming, Unicode, OOP features, etc. The important thing is to never become complacent

* Jump on things others don't like. You can gain specialization, persistence skills and relatively high reward. With data analysis for example: the scripting and visualization part is what everybody loves, but data isn't usually delivered in a ready-to-use format. Data cleaning is not the sexiest of efforts but it is what makes the fun stuff possible. I have seen this in Big Data as well: Spark/ Hive/ Pig etc are cool tools, but what about getting the data in there, ETL is a non-trivial part of the effort. Excel has a similar issue (I picked this up [here](http://www.hanselminutes.com/532/data-literacy-and-the-usefulness-of-excel-with-oz-du-soleil)). 

* Don't ignore the marketing side. I love the tech side, but sometimes we have to step out of this mindset and wonder who our customers are and what they really need. Check out what needs to be build before building it. You must understand what the market wants and how you can improve and package your own skills. Become effective (solve the right problem), then efficient.

* Have a "liability partner". I note that when you are held accountable by a friend or colleague you perform much better. And the joined learning is fun and fruitful. 

* Exercise. Daily exercise pays itself off very quickly: you feel better, you have a good health (the most important asset you can have), and posses a sharper mind (= better code). It's like garbage collection, you can only hold that many things at once, and stress builds up, so you need to clear your mind from time to time. Besides, oftentimes it's when we leave our desk that we actually solve a problem we're stuck on.

Remember you are in charge of your career. Your boss or even family and close friends don't tell you what to do. Secondly technical skills alone only get you that far, often good skill + personable guy outwins the super expert with lack of people skills. In that regard I can highly recommend [Soft Skills](https://www.manning.com/books/soft-skills).
