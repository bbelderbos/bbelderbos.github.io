<p>Wow this is nice. I needed a more automatic way to blog, but I didn't want to separate it from my main website.<br />
IÂ  found a easy + complete solution which I will detail below. My initial skepticism of CMS was blown away seeing the power and flexibility of Wordpress. I only have "touched" the surface, there is much more to find out ..</p>
<p>Quick howto:<br />
a- install wordpress on your domain server. Just upload the wordpress-2.9.x zipfile and put it in a dedicated directory, for example www.mydomain.com/blog. The setup is really easy: create a database and provide the db credentials via the initial webpage. it is recommended to keep this info outside public_html of course<br />
b- pick a nice theme and customize it. There are many beautiful themes and with a little tweaking you have something nice in 15-30 min.<br />
c- embed your latest posts into your existing site with a few lines of php: query_posts('showposts=xx').. .. see this <a title="how to integrate wp in your page" href="http://www.corvidworks.com/articles/wordpress-content-on-other-pages" target="_blank">howto</a><br />
d- (optional) install <a title="ColorBox - customizable lightbox plugin" href="http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/" target="_blank">colorbox</a>, a very nice Jquery plugin, that allows you to show the Wordpress blog in an iframe so that visitors stay on your site. This is a personal flavor, this way I didn't have to make navigation links from my wordpress page back to my site and the whole design just feels more consistent.</p>
