<p>So far I haven't been much into CMS (Content Management System). I like  to fully control my designs and I accept the fact that building  everything manually takes quite some time. The payoff is that you learn  to program in a practical way. Of course this has been possible till now  making relatively small websites.</p>
<p>I will definitely post my findings when I get into CMS. Joomla, Drupal,  ExpressionEngine it seems the latter gets the best critics according to <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/38244/" target="_blank">this comparison</a>.. of course it depends the purpose  of the site you are making. Still, there are two drawbacks using a CMS:  you import a lot of 3rd hand code that needs regular security updates  and secondly design templates might not be that flexible to style/  customize. They say Drupal is hard to customize and even Joomla is  called rigid where it concerns templates.</p>
<p>When I will need to make a larger website (including shopping cart) I  will start with Joomla (free, abundant info available, good starter  guide - see my reading list). ExpressionEngine is not free but it seems  very professional and has a strong support.</p>
<p>For smaller sites I will stubbornly stick to manually programming the  dynamic aspects with php and mysql (and for 2010 I'll set out to learn  what Ruby on Rails has to offer as well!). I think it is important to  stick to some best practices independently the tools you design with  (list is not complete): 1. use includes to have static data stored in  one place (e.g. footer) / 2. use a database to update and present  content / 3. use html semantically and separate styles using CSS / 4.  don't forget that good content is key and make sure google can find it  (SEO)</p>
<p>Happy New Year! Bob</p>
