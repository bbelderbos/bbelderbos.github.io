<h3>Intro</h3>

In [The Unusual Books That Shaped 50+ Billionaires, Mega-Bestselling Authors, and Other Prodigies](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/12/10/the-unusual-books-that-shaped-50-billionaires-mega-bestselling-authors-and-other-prodigies/) Tim Ferriss provides a mega-list of the most-gifted and favorite books of top performers. I wondered which books were mentioned more than once?


<h3>Pre-work</h3>

* Inspect the html, first I got a copy with wget

* Recommended books have amazon in them

* An exception is his own new book but it occurs only once

* I checked there were 204 Amazon links to assert that in my script

<h3>Code</h3>

	from collections import Counter
	from itertools import dropwhile
	import os
	import re

	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup
	import requests

	AMAZON = "amazon.com"
	CACHED_HTML = "titans_books.html"
	SHORT_SRC = "http://bit.ly/2gP0fv3"

	title = re.compile(r'.*{}/([^/]+).*'.format(AMAZON)).sub

	def get_html():
		if os.path.isfile(CACHED_HTML):
			with open(CACHED_HTML) as f:
				html = f.read().lower()
		else:
			html = requests.get(SHORT_SRC).text
		return Soup(html, 'html5lib')

	def get_books():
		cnt = Counter()
		for a in get_html().find_all('a', href=True):
			href = a['href']
			if AMAZON in href:
				book = title(r'\1', href)
				cnt[book] += 1
		return cnt

	def get_multiple_mentions(books, keep=2):
		for key, count in dropwhile(lambda key_count: key_count[1] >= keep, books.most_common()):
			del books[key]
		return books

	def print_results(books):
		for book, count in books.items():
			print("{:<3} {}".format(count, book))


	if __name__ == "__main__":
		def test(cnt):
			assert(cnt["tao-te-ching-laozi"] == 3)
			assert(cnt["influence-psychology-persuasion-robert-cialdini"] == 2)
			assert(sum(cnt.values()) == 204)

		books = get_books()
		test(books)
		multiple_mentions = get_multiple_mentions(books)
		print_results(multiple_mentions)

<h3>Some Py habits</h3>

* Seperate standard library modules from external ones, here BeautifulSoup and requests go in their own block, it scans more easily.

* Use constantes, uppercase, at the top, except method aliases and named tuples (not used here) for which I use lowercase.

* I like the re.compile(r'').sub construct / definition (I saw Peter Norvig using it in a regex golf), it leads to more compact code in the body of the method that uses it: 

		# at top: 
		title = re.compile(r'.*{}/([^/]+).*'.format(AMAZON)).sub

		# in method: 
		book = title(r'\1', href)

* Use small methods that do one thing, and use method interfaces small (2 to 3 args most)

* If not using unittests for more serious work it's very easy to at least add some assert statements, in this case 3 asserts pretty much guarantees the program will behave as expected (again, one of the first things I checked in the raw html was that there were 204 total Amazon links)

        assert(sum(cnt.values()) == 204)
        assert(cnt["tao-te-ching-laozi"] == 3)
        assert(cnt["influence-psychology-persuasion-robert-cialdini"] == 2)

* Don't re-invent the wheel: Counter, BeautifulSoup and requests provide awesome functionality / interfaces, use them.

* String formatting: use "{}".format(var) over old-style %s, hard to beat this in terms of elegance / compactness:

		print("{:<3} {}".format(count, book))

* Download html for testing (CACHED_HTML), I use an if/else so if html is there (dev) use it, if not (ran elsewhere) use requests.

<h3>Bonus golf ... Just for fun, can we make it tweet sized?</h3>

This is just for fun, don't write code like this for maintainability (use the long format above)

Answer is: with a cheat.

I could fit it into 139 chars, but: 

* without the imports, so when you import (pip install) requests, BeautifulSoup and Counter this works:

* not extracting the title, below I am counting Amazon URLs

	>>> import requests
	>>> from collections import Counter
	>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup
	>>> cmd = "Counter(a['href'] for a in Soup(requests.get('http://bit.ly/2gP0fv3').text).find_all('a', href=True) if 'zon' in a['href']).most_common(20)"
	>>> assert(len(cmd) <= 140)
	>>> eval(cmd)
    ...
    ...

<h3>Conclusion: practice!</h3>

Apart from seriously wanting to know which books repeatingly came up, 'silly' exercises like these do help. You stumble upon a lot of things, even for a relatively easy script as this. If you need inspiration, opportunities are everywhere. For example, I was doing a Javascript course and wanted to know the total time. I ended up using re.find_all (I did not use that much till then) to sum all videos mm:ss timestamps (converting them to seconds). Code katas are great for learning!
