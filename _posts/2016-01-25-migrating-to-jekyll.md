title: Migrating my blog to Jekyll
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From the [readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.


## Hello, Jekyll 

Here are some links and notes from the migration I am doing from Wordpress to Jekyll: 

1. get started: very [good post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) which starts with the poole base theme.

2. you need to install some dependencies and I needed to changes to _config.yml to get it running locally, see [here](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/issues/124)

3. import posts from WP, see [here](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/) and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31216857/import-wordpress-posts-in-jekyll) - how awesome:

        $ ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import"; JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({ "source" => "bobbelderbos.wordpress.2016-01-27.xml" } )'
