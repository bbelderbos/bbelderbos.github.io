## I did it :)

Just before O'Reilly School of Technology (OST) [closes](http://www.oreillyschool.com/), I managed to get certified in Advanced Java, more details [here](http://bobbelderbos.com/certifications) (java5 and -6). 

I am pretty happy and proud of this achievement. The two modules were known to be the most complex ones the school had to offer and some exercises were a real struggle, but hey ... that's how you learn, right? I got some good practice in distributed app development and algorithms (30 coding projects). 

I copied the (already publicly available) course PDFs to my [certifications page](http://bobbelderbos.com/certifications) if interested.

For those interested in algorithms: 

* The author of the algorithms part of this certificate has a [good video course](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000667.do) where he goes over a lot of the same material using Python. 
* Coursera just kicked off [Algorithms, part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) (Princeton).
