Core skill set: 10 years of experience developing tools and applications for automation, data mining, and solving complex business problems.

I studied business but discovered early that I am really passionate about programming, web development and automation. Since 2010 I have been sharing my learning on software development here. I [certified in Python and Java](http://bobbelderbos.com/certifications) at the O'Reilly School of Technology. Although my current focus is on learning Big Data / Hadoop, I am flexible in learning the best technology for the job.

I characterize myself as organized, analytical, proactive, integer, goal-oriented, a good team player, and an effective communicator. One of my most important traits is that I am continuously working on becoming better in my field.

Apart from delivering high quality solutions with an eye for detail, I am innovative and strategic in my thinking and a natural connector. People I work with say I am personable and empathic. That's why I aim to be a mentor/ inspiration for other developers.

I speak Spanish / English / Dutch natively and some French. I enjoy learning languages and working in multicultural teams. I enjoy learning languages/ working in multicultural teams, reading (podcasts), and highly value fitness and health.
