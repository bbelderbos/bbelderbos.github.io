## My experience

Core skill set: 10 years of experience developing tools and applications for automation, data mining, and solving complex business problems.

I studied business but discovered early that I am really passionate about software development. I obtained certifications in Python, Java and Android programming (O'Reilly School of Technology). I share my learning on software development, coding and web technologies at http://bobbelderbos.com/. I am currently learning more about Algorithms, Big Data (Hadoop) and leading (agile) teams.

I characterize myself as organized, analytical, proactive, integer, goal-oriented, a good team player, and an effective communicator. One of my most important traits is that I am continuously working on becoming better in my field.

Apart from delivering high quality solutions with eye for detail, I am innovative and strategic in my thinking and a natural connector. People I work with say I am personable and empathic. That's why I aim to be a mentor/inspiration for other developers. 

Languages: fluent in Spanish / English / Dutch, conversation skills in French. I enjoy learning languages and working in multicultural teams.
